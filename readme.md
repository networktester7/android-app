## Introduction
By 2029, an estimated 1.8 billion people worldwide will be using smartphones, with iOS and Android as the dominant players (Global: Number of smartphone users, 2025). Mobile devices and applications are no longer for personal use only but have become a vital part of the technology ecosystem for most organizations. This project will outline the development of an Android mobile inventory application for a hypothetical medical device company and its sales force. 

## Project Description
This project will develop an Android mobile inventory application that will synchronize an API with the user’s device to request inventory data from either a website or a server data base. Once the application downloads the requested data, it will display current inventory on the device screen. The user will also be able to search for a medical device from within the app.

## Problem Addressing
As private users and organizations become increasingly dependent on smartphones for critical data, mobile applications must keep up with the rapidly advancing technological landscape. Medical sales representatives are often called into emergency surgeries from remote locations. On the road, a rep may not have access to a computer and/or the internet. Checking hospital inventory from a computer is also laborious and time consuming. 

As a sales representative, it is imperative to have hospital inventory data available at a moment’s notice. Inventory data must be searchable, accurate, accessible instantaneously, and secure within the network connection. An Android mobile inventory app will solve this common sales team problem by providing immediate access to live inventory from an Android smartphone or watch, saving time and possibly a life. 

## Platform
The platform is Android OS and will primarily target smartphone devices.

## Front/Back-End Support
The backend is a MySQL Server that binds to PHP through Apache to handle requests. The PHP server handles the login, add, and subtract requests. The employees can instantly see in real time how much quanities are available. 

## Functionality
The functionality is going to consist of a display interface that shows the current inventory available at a hospital location, as well as a search function to allow the user to search for a specific medical device (e.g. an IV Fluid.

## Currently functioning features:
1. Login screen that authenticates with main app
2. Users are able to view the database and the quantities of the items
3. Users can add quantites of items
4. Users can subtract items from the inventory.
