# Android Mobile Inventory Application

## Introduction
By 2029, an estimated 1.8 billion people worldwide will be using smartphones, with iOS and Android as the dominant players (Global: Number of smartphone users, 2025). Mobile devices and applications are no longer for personal use only but have become a vital part of the technology ecosystem for most organizations. This project will outline the development of an Android mobile live inventory application for a hypothetical medical device company and its sales force. 

## Project Description
This project will develop an Android mobile inventory application that will synchronize an API with the user’s device to request live time inventory data from either a website or a server data base. Once the application downloads the requested data, it will display current inventory on the device screen. The user will also be able to search for a medical device from within the app.


## Problem Addressing
As private users and organizations become increasingly dependent on smartphones for critical data, mobile applications must keep up with the rapidly advancing technological landscape. Medical sales representatives are often called into emergency surgeries from remote locations. As a surgical device sales representative, it is imperative to have inventory data available at a moment’s notice. Inventory data must be searchable, accurate, accessible instantaneously, and secure within the network connection. On the road, a rep may not have access to a computer and/or the internet. Checking hospital inventory from a computer is also laborious and time consuming. An Android mobile inventory app will solve this common sales team problem by providing immediate access to live inventory from an Android smartphone or watch, saving time and possiby a life. 

## Platform
The platform is Android OS and will primarily target smartphone devices.

## Front/Back-End Support
The backend is going to consist of an inventory database API service that distributes live hopital inventory data to sales team devices.

## Functionality
The functionality is going to consist of a display interface that shows the current inventory available at hospital locations, as well as a search function to allow the user to search for a specific medical device (i.e. a heart valve size).
